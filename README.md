# My Web Development Portfolio

## Development Process

When I started building this portfolio, I wanted to create something that would not only showcase my technical skills but also reflect my personality and design aesthetic. I began by creating wireframes on figma (https://www.figma.com/design/TyVd0ARlBEyQLgN6gAbSo7/Baines_ryan_prototype?node-id=0-1&t=85E5pqX9Z2UwddsC-1) to visualize the overall structure.

My approach followed these steps:
1. Research and gather inspiration from other muiscians portfolios
2. Plan the site architecture and design
3. Create wireframes and mockups in figma
4. Develop the core structure with HTML
5. Style with CSS (focusing on responsive design)
6. Test across different devices and browsers

## Challenges & Solutions
### Responsive Design
One of the biggest challenges was ensuring the portfolio looked great across all device sizes. I initially struggled with layout shifts on mobile devices. To solve this, I implemented a mobile-first approach and used CSS Grid and Flexbox extensively, which significantly improved the responsiveness :>

### Performance Optimization
As I added more images, the site began to slow down (pretty minor though). I tackled this by:
- Compressing and optimizing all images

## What I've Learned
This project has been incredibly educational. I've learned that:

- Planning is crucial - having a clear vision before coding saves tremendous time (seriously)
- Consistent testing throughout development prevents major issues later
- User feedback is invaluable - what seems intuitive to me might not be to others!!
- Web performance optimization is an art in itself lol
- Documentation is just as important as the code!!

Perhaps most importantly, I've learned to embrace the iterative nature of development. This portfolio isn't per say "finished" - but rather it's a living project that will continue to evolve as I grow as a developer :3
